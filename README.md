Cart API Code challenge: part of the interview process at Pixartprinting

_Dear candidate,_

_*We hope you are excited to take this challenge, as much as we will, when reviewing your code*_ :smile:

## Forewords

_*The aim is NOT to see a full working project, production ready, rather to have a glance of your programming skills, approach and ability to solve a problem,*_

Take your time to solve this challenge: time is important but not the most...

You don't need to rush into delivering us a solution, but it can't also take forever.

You don't need to overdo or develop any possible aspect of the application, keep **focus on the most relevant aspects** and those requested by specification.

We will support you in accessing this repo and cloning it

**IMPORTANT:**
As soon as you clone this repo:

- add a CONTRIBUTING.md file push it to your own GitHub repository account, 
- then please share your own repo with your contact person's GithHub account

## Cart Challenge description

We want you to create a REST API to implement the following business requirements collected from our e-commerce Cart use case session.
We are a "web to print" company:

customers connect to our e-commerce, then choose a product, select number of copies to print (quantity) along with a desired delivery date.
Add to Cart. Checkout the Cart.

To have an idea on how we add to cart products, selecting: quantity/date, please have look at a live example: [Product Page](https://www.pixartprinting.co.uk/digital-litho-printing/printing-business-cards/)

### Cart creation

We create a cart by specifying :

`ecommerce_id` , `customer_id`, a `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

Cart `status` possible values are : `created`, `building` , `checkout`

### Add Items to Cart

We add items to Cart by providing `ecommerce_id`, `customer_id` and `item_list`

Each entity in `item_list` has the following details:

`product_sku`, `product_name`, `file_type`, `quantity`, `delivery_date`

For this challenge consider:

The `file_type` as a string value indicating the file's MIME type
The `delivery_date` is the choosen date for delivery by a customer
The `quantity` is the number of items for the same product

### View a Cart

The client should be able to query an API endpoint checking what's inside the Cart  

API will return the following details:
Cart `ecommerce_id`, `customer_id`, `created_at` the `status`, eventually a total `price`

The `item_list` with `product_sku`, `product_name`, `file_type`, `quantity`, `delivery_date`.
The calculated `price` for the item based on the policies below.

### Cart checkout

The customer will checkout the cart, the API will set the Cart `date_checkout`
and will calculate and set the final price for the cart

### Price policies calculation

- Let's assume all our products on our catalog have a same standard base price of 1,00â‚¬ per item
- When you buy more items of same `product_sku` :
  - no discount is applied for quantities until 100
  - a 5% discount is applied for quantities above 100
  - a 10% discount is applied for quantities above 250
  - a 15% discount is applied for quantities above 500
  - a 20% discount is applied for quantities above 1000
- When the choosen delivery date is (compared to Cart date checkout ):
  - within 24h price increments 30%
  - within 48h price increments 20%
  - within 72h price increments 10%
  - within 1 week price have no increment
- For PDF type formats the price is 15% more than the standard one.
- For PSD type formats (Adobe Photoshop) the price is 35% more than the standard one.
- For AI type formats (Adobe Illustrator) the price is 25% more than the standard one.
